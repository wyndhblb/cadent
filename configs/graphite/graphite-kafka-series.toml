##  Kafka-Series ONLY writer
##
##  note the `backend = "BLACKHOLE"` below, this implys the Lines stop at the writer
##  note also there is no "render" API here (unless you have another cadent process that is writing
##  and you can hook things in here to take advantage of the cached series)
##  There are 2 flush windows, 5s and 1m. That will be emitted once they hit 1024 bytes as the gorilla series format
